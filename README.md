Lucille - Eternity server is the backend server that is currently in development. I am refactoring the code to make it cleaner and more efficient, avoiding magic numbers and strings. There is no need to handle multiple game sessions/lobbies as I see no use in that. The goal currently is to get a MVP up and running with a lobby system, player roles, and basic game mechanics. After that, I will focus on polishing the game and adding more features.
